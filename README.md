# Cucumber UAT Starter Project

This is a simple blank starter project for doing automated User
Acceptance Testing with cucumber and selenium for web based
applications.

## Requirements

This project requires a functional Ruby environment

## Getting Started

Fork this repository and clone it onto your local machine.

If you use RVM to manage your Ruby installations, you probably want to
set up an isolated gemset for your UAT testing.

```
rvm --create 2.2@uat
```

Then, you need to ensure you have bundler installed and install the
dependencies.

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```
